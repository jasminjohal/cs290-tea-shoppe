## About

This is a website for a _fictional_ boba tea shop that I created for my CS 290 course (Web Development) at Oregon State University. It is designed to showcase basic HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS skills.

It features a landing page with a slideshow of images and a `Menu` page with a button at the top of the page to download the menu in pdf form, a list of the various tea customizations available for purchase, and an order calculator. There is also an `About` page, which contains a short description of the
history and background of the tea shop, and a `Contact` page, which contains a form where customers can enter their contact information and submit a question or
comment. All pages have a `Connect` area in the footer to stage icons that link to the tea shopâ€™s social media accounts (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Yelp, etc.). All pages also have a navbar at the top of the page with links to the `Home`, `Menu`, `About` and `Contact` pages.
